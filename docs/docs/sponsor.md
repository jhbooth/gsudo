## Sponsor gsudo

Please consider sponsoring my open source work, mainly on gsudo. I have dedicated my free time for months making this project.

It also helps support the costs of the yearly renewal for the code-signing certificate.

> To provide a signed application (and not let the UAC popup show "Untrusted Publisher", which also protects end users by helping them detect that gsudo binaries hadnÂ´t been altered) I have paid 56 USD each year, since 2020, for an Open-Source Code-Signing certificate. The [last purchase](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo/issues/82) expired in Apr 2022. Please consider sponsoring me to ensure I can provide signed binaries for another year.
